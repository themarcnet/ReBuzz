# ReBuzz - Complete Build fork
Hello, this is my Complete ReBuzz fork.  This fork allows for a complete build of ReBuzz, including dependencies, 3rd party stuff, and runtime files.

You do not (should not - I have not tested assertion) need to install ReBuzz to build this fork of Rebuzz.

This fork will build / copy everything required into the output 'bin' folder, which is located at the root of your local git repository.  ReBuzz can then be run from that location.

# What is ReBuzz ?
ReBuzz is a modular digital audio workstation (DAW) built upon the foundation of [Jeskola Buzz](https://jeskola.net/buzz/) software. Written in C#, ReBuzz combines modern features with the beloved workflow of its predecessor. While itâ€™s still in development, users should exercise some caution regarding stability and other potential uncertainties. The primary focus is on providing a stable experience and robust VST support.

## Features
* 32 and 64 bit VST2/3 support
* 32 and 64 bit buzz machine support
* Modern Pattern Editor, Modern Sequence Editor, AudioBlock, EnvelopeBlock, CMC, TrackScript...
* Multi-process architecture
* Multi-io for native and managed machines
* Includes [NWaves](https://github.com/ar1st0crat/NWaves) .NET DSP library for audio processing
* bmx and bmxml file support
* ...
